## Reactive Programming

In computing, reactive programming is a declarative programming paradigm concerned with data streams and the propagation of change. With this paradigm, it's possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) data streams with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated execution model exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow

## WHAT?

---

## [ReactiveX](https://reactivex.io/)

- An API for asynchronous programming
  with observable streams
- The Observer pattern done right
- ReactiveX is a combination of the best ideas from
  the Observer pattern, the Iterator pattern, and functional programming

## Moving parts

- Event loop ( & a supervisor)
- asynchronous functions
- functional programming
