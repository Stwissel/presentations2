# Who and where

First order of a ranger: establish location

---

## People & Places

- `whoami` - the big question
- `w` - who is there
- `pwd` - print working directory

---

## The machine

- uname -a : Kernel
- cat /etc/os-release : Version
- mount : file system (scary)
- free -t : free memory
- top : Processes
- uptime : how long is it running
