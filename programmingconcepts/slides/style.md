# Style

- Separate framework from business logic
- Write your test first
- pure functions are easy to test
- name variables, functions and methods after their business purpose
- prefer declarative over imperative
- dependency injection is just a fancy word for "don't instanciate side effect bearers inside your function
- Learn state diagrams
